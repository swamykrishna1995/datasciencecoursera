Instructions
The analysis process consists of two parts. The first part is data retrieval and extraction. This is dealt with by the retrieve_data.R script. To retrieve the data perform the following steps:

Set the working directory to the directory that contains the retrieve_data.R and the run_analysis.R scripts.
Run the following command: > source('retrieve_data.R')
Run the following command: > retrieveData()
Optionally, there is the cleanData() function which removes all downloaded data after which retrieveData() can be called to start with a clean slate.

The second part consist of merging the test and training data, and to create the summary data set. This is implemented in the run_analysis.R script.

source('run_analysis.R')
The resulting summary data is stored in: data/variable_average_per_subject.csv
